This is a game programme based on `Snake-Water-Gun similar` to the the `Rock-Paper-Scissor.`
also another guess number game included in this programme.

Their is no any OOPs concept used in this programme, only basic concepts are used.
playable in code editor terminal or you can compile and run executable file any where on your desktop.


compile only in offline environment.
don't try to execute on online c++ compiler, online compiler can throw error because online compiler
doesn't have `<windows.h>` library in i's directory.

I hope you will enjoy my small piece of code. @ohm
