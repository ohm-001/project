This is a game programme based on `Snake-Water-Gun similar` to the the `Rock-Paper-Scissor.`

**Game_swg Class:** This class represents the `Snake-Water-Gun game`. It includes methods for various aspects of the game, such as the `welcome animation`, `setting player names`, `displaying rules`, `running the game`, and `handling user input`.

**Game_guess Class:** This class inherits from `Game_swg` and represents the **guessing number game**. It includes methods for **generating a random number**, allowing the user to `guess the number`, and `determining if the user wants to play again`.

**Main Function:** The main function **initializes and runs the Snake-Water-Gun game**, and then it **asks the user if they want to play the guessing number game. The program continues until the *user guess correct number*.

**Helper Functions:** There are several helper functions for `setting text color`, `creating loading animations`, and `printing messages with various styles`.

**Windows-Specific Functions:** The program uses the `**Windows API (windows.h)**` to manipulate `console text colors`. This program is *designed* to run on `Windows systems`.

Overall, it's a fun and interactive program that combines two different games and includes colorful animations and text. However, it's worth noting that it relies on Windows-specific features and may not work as intended on non-Windows systems. Additionally, since it uses a console-based interface, it's best run in a command prompt or terminal.

I hope you will enjoy my small piece of code. @ohm
