This is a game program based on `Snake-Water-Gun` similar to the `Rock-Paper-Scissor.`

**Game_swg Class:** This class represents the _Snake-Water-Gun game_. It includes methods for various aspects of the game, such as the _welcome animation_, _setting player names_, _playing rules_, _run game_, and _handling user input_.

**Game_guess Class:** It includes methods for `generating a random number`, allowing the user to `guess the number`.

**Main Function:** The main function _initializes and runs the Snake-Water-Gun game_, and then it _asks the user if they want to play again._ The program continues until the *user guess correct number*.

**Helper Functions:** There are several helper functions for `setting text color`, `loading animations`, and `printing string with various styles`.

**Windows-Specific Functions:** The program uses the `Windows API (windows.h)` to manipulate `console text colors`. This program is *designed* to run on `Windows systems`.

Overall, it's a fun and interactive program that combines two different games and _includes colorful animations_ and text. However, it's worth noting that it relies on _Windows-specific features_ and may not work as intended on non-Windows systems. Additionally, since it uses a console-based interface, it's best run in a `command prompt or terminal`.
