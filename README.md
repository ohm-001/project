This is a mini project (c++) based on `Snake-Water-Gun` Game similar to the `Rock-Paper-Scissor` and another one is `Guess the Number` Game both are in same program.

The idea behind this game is any way of the <sup>3</sup>P<sub>2</sub> (distinct) object selected by `user` && `program` gives result, either one of them will be the `winner` by some logic
or, in case of <sup>3</sup>P<sub>1</sub> (when both are identical) match is `drawn.`
 and another game idea is to guess the random number selected by the `program.`

**Game_swg Class:** This class represents the _Snake-Water-Gun game_. It includes methods for various aspects of the game, such as the _welcome animation_, _setting player names_, _playing rules_, _run game_, and _handling user input_.

**Game_guess Class:** It includes methods for `generating a random number`, allowing the user to `guess the number`.

**Main Function:** The main function _initializes and runs the Snake-Water-Gun game_, and then it _asks the user if they want to play again._ run guess number game function until the *user guess correct number*.

**Helper Functions:** There are several helper functions for `setting text color`, `loading animations`, and `printing string with various styles`.

**Windows-Specific Functions:** The program uses the `Windows API (windows.h)` to manipulate `console text colors`. This program is *designed* to run on `Windows systems`.

Overall, it's a fun and interactive program that combines two different games and _includes colorful animations_ and text. However, it's worth noting that it relies on _Windows-specific features_ and may not work on non-Windows systems. since, it uses a console-based interface, it's best run in a `command prompt or terminal`.
