Hello! I'm Om a student of DAV Institute of Engineering and Technology palamu.

This is a game programme based on Snake-Water-Gun similar to the the Rock-Paper-Scissor.
also another guess number game included in this programme.

Their is no any OOPs concept used in this programme, only basic concepts are used.
playable in code editor terminal or you can compile and run executable file any where on your desktop.
For vscode editor look edit your link above add '1s' after github as --> github1s.com

compile only in offline environment.
don't try to execute on online c++ compiler, online compiler can throw error because online compiler
doesn`t have <windows.h> library in it`s directory.

I hope you will enjoy my small piece of code. @ohm
